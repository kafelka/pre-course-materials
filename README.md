# Pre Course Materials

In addition to the [minimum application requirements](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/academy/#apply) listed on the FAC website, there are a number of quality free resources available to applicants on the web which will help lay a great foundation for the course. This repo includes all the minimum application requirements and builds upon them with additional recomendations.

## Further Information

If you have completed these lists and are looking for further reading, this [FAC resource list](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/tree/f9a5c0ff05007c55d886b3fa1885020fe0eebd94) is pretty extensive!

Any recomendations, comment them [here]() or feel free to add them yourself. Anything that isn't suitable as a pre-course resource would be better added to the more extensive [FAC resource list](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/tree/f9a5c0ff05007c55d886b3fa1885020fe0eebd94).
